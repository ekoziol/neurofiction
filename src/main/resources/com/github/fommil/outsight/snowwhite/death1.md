A row of skulls, grinning visages of death. Medical images: brains inside fragile carapaces, the dark scribble of a hematoma marring one. 

A nuclear explosion. First, a burning golden sun too bright to look at, a perfect disc. White rings smooth like eggshells appear around it. The disc folds into itself, becomes uneven and two-lobed, like a burning fusion brain. An inverted avalanche of dirt rises from the ground to envelope it, breaks the bright colours with grey and brown, until only a faded dark pillar remains. And then the sound comes, shaking the laptopâ€™s speakers.

[TODO a witch? ]

And finally, an apple. It turns slowly from green to bright red.
