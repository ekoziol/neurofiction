This is a Turing machine. 

You can't tell what it will do, until it does. It might run forever, or stutter to a halt after a few steps. Add two and two. Compose a symphony. Simulate all other Turing machines. Simulate you reading these words: you might be nothing but ones and zeroes on a tape, shuffled back and forth by a mindless mechanical godhead. 

It is like an apple, given to you by a witch. You won't know if you get the red side or the green side, until you bite. 

So we have to build it. 

We could use almost anything. Paper and a pencil and a brain. Vacuum tubes and bicycle wheels and wire. Lego. Words and emotions. Apples and poison. Life and death. 

We'll start with money. 

Take out four coins and put them on top of a piece of paper in front of you, side by side. Turn them heads up. Label them by I, II, III and IV, from left to right. 

The coins are the four stories in the machine. For each story, the coin tells you if Snow White is alive or not. 

* Heads mean Snow White is alive, raven-haired, rosy-cheeked, ivory-skinned. No matter how bad things seem, she is going to live. 

* Tails mean Snow White is dead, truly dead. She lies under the glass in her coffin, the too-sweet taste of the green side of the apple on her lips. She will never wake up. 

The most important part of the machine is you. 

Take out another coin and put it above or below coin number III. This is the you coin. It marks the story you will read next.  

* If you feel *happy* (smiling, touched, aroused), and the story coin shows *heads*, read the story, turn the story coin over, and move the you coin one step *right*. 

* If you feel *sad* (or angry, or melancholy, or disappointed) and the story coin shows *heads*, read the story, turn the story coin over and move the you coin one step *left*. 

* If you feel *happy*, and the story coin shows *tails*, read the story, leave the coin alone, and move one step *left*. 

* If you feel *sad* and the story coin shows *tails*, read the story and stop. That is where the machine halts and Snow White's story ends. 

Now, take a moment to think about things that make you happy. What it felt like to build a sandcastle as a child, or to wake up next to someone you love. What the first pint of the night tastes like. Do it until you are smiling. 

Then start reading story number three. After you are finished, turn the third story coin over. Then follow the rules: they give the Turing machine life. Or death. 

You should be a little bit afraid for Snow White.
