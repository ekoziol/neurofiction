The doctor found her online. It was one of those links you click on when you are bored. A kind of digital shrine to a girl in a coma. There were pictures of her, and a shaky mobile video. In it, she sat on stairs, wearing a yellow skirt. Suddenly, she looked up at him and smiled. There was a blue bruise on her cheek, but the smile was red and joyous, trusting and innocent. 

He watched it three times and knew he loved her. 

He requested a transfer to her hospital. The usual weight of names and money made it happen. 

He found her in a bare room with yellow walls. She smelled of a brain trauma patient's heavy body cream, and something sweet beneath.

He wanted to see behind her eyes. He wanted to fight the black blood dragon in her brain.

He takes out a glass bottle with an obscure label and fills a syringe. With sure fingers, he finds a blue vein in her arm. The clear fluid goes in, smoothly: another impossible thing that only a prince could buy. When the needle comes out, it leaves behind a tiny drop of blood on her skin, a ruby sphere, perfectly formed. He kisses it away. 

He disconnects her from the machines, gently removes the drips, untangles her raven hair from the electrodes. The green lines on the screens go flat. 

He holds her hand and waits for her to wake. 

Outside, there is birdsong.
