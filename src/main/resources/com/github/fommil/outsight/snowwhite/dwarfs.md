# The Dwarves

Little by little, we gather all her pieces together, in the glass coffin. Her emails, her Facebook updates, her health records. The duck-face pictures, the cosplay posing. The video from the convention, the one where she smiles. 

It takes hours of coding in the dark. Our faces are cratered alien planets in the monitor glow, greasy from lack of sleep. The flat is hot with the breath of our machines. 

She came to us on the last day of the convention. We returned home as heroes that evening. We had flirted with cosplayer girls, argued Star Trek and LOTR trivia with our rivals, hunted for Babylon 5 star autographs. For once, we belonged. Afterwards, we all felt something had changed. 

It was Simo who saw her first and described her to the rest of us. He was good at that. When we played Dungeons and Dragons, he was always the Game Master. With just words, he could paint caverns and orcs and shimmering magic swords and make them real. And so we listened to him and saw. 

She slept in Simoâ€™s bed, curled up under a blanket, wearing his Red Lantern T-shirt. We had seen her before, from afar, in blue and yellow and red, with the other Snows. She didn't have the cleavage of the superhero Snow or the madcap energy of the zombie one. But out of all of them, she was the most beautiful. 

We looked at her and did not know what to do. Then she opened her eyes. 

"Do you guys mind if I stay a while?" she asked. 

And that was how Lumi came to live with us. 

She was always there in the evening. She never said what she did during the day, and we did not ask. But she always had a kind, sarcastic word for each of us. And like manic pixie dream girls do, she would get us to do crazy things. Go to the roof and look at the stars. Compliment random people on the street. Dye our hairs and beards in different colours. 

We all wanted her, but there was an unspoken agreement. No one tried to touch her, or to claim her. To do anything would have shattered the illusion that she belonged to us. 

So of course Jyri had to screw it up. 

It was a small thing, he told us later. She was in the kitchen, one night, sitting at the table. She had done the dishes, lit scented candles. Her old bruise had faded but a shadow was still there. She had been crying. She kept looking at her iPhone. The logo flashed when she turned it in her hand, a silver eyeblink. 

Is everything all right, Jyri asked. 

It's nothing, she said. Just my mom. 

Jyri could see that something had bitten into her mind and she was no longer ours. He felt desperate. He laid his hand on hers, hairy and thick-fingered. 

You can tell me, he said. I'm a good listener, not like the others, they just want to make you into what they want you to be. But I'm here for you. 

She pulled her hand away and clicked the display of the phone shut. 

But I'm not really here, she said. I'm in the mirror. 

She kissed Jyri's cheek. 

Tell the others goodbye for me. 

Her breath smelled sweet. Jyri closed his eyes. When he opened them, he saw her lying on the floor, green eyes wide open. It was only then that he saw the jar of pills, in her hand.

That was how Lumi left us. 

When the morning comes, she is there, complete, beneath the glass of our screens. We stare at her, wanting, missing, afraid to touch. Jyri bites down tears. Ismo swears. Mikko tugs at his beard. She is beautiful and bright, and for a moment she is ours again. 

Then Ismo makes the site public, and we set her free.
