The princess sleeps in the hospital bed, and the young doctor watches her dreams. 

She is the faded image of a beautiful girl: pale sunken cheeks, tangled black hair, lips with the faintest hint of red. The electroencephalography cap makes her head into a forest of wires and electrodes. She looks gaunt and old. Her skin is paper-thin, full of wounds and bedsores. Her teeth are marred by caries. 

She is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. 

She breathes out, and the laptop screen becomes a snowstorm. 

They did it with cats first: decoded the visual centre of the brain, stitched fragments of feline dreams together with electricity and algorithms. At first, the images are hazy. The main window shows an amber flame, dancing and wavering. The software tries to match it to a grid of YouTube video clips, a mosaic assembled from fragments of  collective subconscious.
