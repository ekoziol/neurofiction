# The Queen

Today, she is going to kill her husband. 

As she wakes up, the thought brings warm joy that spreads through her limbs like a massage. She stretches luxuriously in the empty bed: he is in an early morning meeting. The girl is gone, too. She feels her absence in the hushed silence of the house, and smiles.

She walks through the house naked, glorying in the morning light on her flawless skin. In a few hours, it will all belong to her: the clean lines of the designer furniture, the calm of the frozen pier and the beach sauna, all the little symbols of power.  

She makes herself a coffee, sits on the couch, cradles the hot cup against your bare belly, and turn on the TV. 

She does not really watch it, though. She can already see what it will show tomorrow. The shattered glass, the black ice, the blood. The dark Sedan that came out of nowhere, crushing the minister's car on the driver's side. 

What they won't show is her hand, unbuckling her husband's seat belt, or her last smile in the rearview mirror. Those are just for him. 

Afterwards, the TV will show her. She will be stricken with grief but strong, ready to take up your husband's burdens for the party. She will have a single white bandage on your pale forehead, perhaps, dabbed with blood. It will make her seem fragile and beautiful. 

Except that something is wrong. The ghosts of tomorrow are whispering. And they are not talking about her, they are talking about *her*. The little princess who died, with the raven hair and rosy cheeks. They can't get enough of her. After today, the little bitch will live forever. 

She can't let that happen. 

She turns the TV off. An old naked woman stares back at her from the black slab of the screen, hunched and pale. 

She has to make them forget her. Make them hate her. 

She remembers the dress the girl was making, from the cartoon, yellow and blue with a red bow tie. 

Best of all would be to make them laugh at the little bitch. 

The smile returns to her lips, and she feels beautiful again. She picks up her phone and make a call.
