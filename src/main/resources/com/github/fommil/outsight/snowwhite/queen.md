Today, you are going to kill your husband. 

As you wake up, the thought brings warm joy that spreads through your limbs like a massage. You stretch luxuriously in the empty bed: he is in an early morning meeting. The girl is gone, too. You feel her absence in the hushed silence of the house, and smile. 

You walk through the house naked, glorying in the morning light on your flawless skin. In a few hours, it will all belong to you: the clean lines of the designer furniture, the calm of the frozen pier and the beach sauna, all the little symbols of power.  

You make yourself a coffee, sit on the couch, cradle the hot cup against your bare belly, and turn on the TV. 

You do not really watch it, though. You can already see what it will show tomorrow. The shattered glass, the black ice, the blood. The dark Sedan that came out of nowhere, crushing the minister's car on the driver's side. 

What they won't show is your hand, unbuckling your husband's seat belt, or your last smile in the rearview mirror. Those are just for him. 

Afterwards, the TV will show you. You will be stricken with grief but strong, ready to take up your husband's burdens for the party. You will have a single white bandage on your pale forehead, perhaps, dabbed with blood. It will make you seem fragile and beautiful. 

Except that something is wrong. The ghosts of tomorrow are whispering. And they are not talking about you, they are talking about *her*. The little princess who died, with the raven hair and rosy cheeks. They can't get enough of her. After today, she will live forever. 

You can't let that happen. 

You turn the TV off. An old naked woman stares back at you from the black slab of the screen, hunched and pale. 

You have to make them forget her. Make them hate her. 

You remember the dress she was making, from the cartoon, yellow and blue with a red bow tie. 

Best of all would be to make them laugh at her. 

The smile returns to your lips, and you feel beautiful again. You pick up your phone and make a call.
