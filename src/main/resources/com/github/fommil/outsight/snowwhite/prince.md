The princess sleeps, and the young doctor watches her dreams. 

The electroencephalography cap makes her head into a forest of wires and electrodes. She looks gaunt and old. But he only cares about what lies beneath her skin. 

He found her online. It was one of those links you click on when you are bored. A kind of digital shrine to an unknown girl. First, darkness on the screen, sound of breathing. Then, music, quick and upbeat. Instagram-tinted duckface shots. A shaking mobile phone video of a raven-haired girl, swirling around in a yellow skirt. A photo of her, sitting on the street, looking up, smiling, a bruise on her cheek. A sudden darkness. Voices from the news. The girl in bed, eyes closed. Medical images: the dark shadow of a haematoma against her skull. 

He watched it three times and knew he loved her. 

He requested a transfer to her hospital. The usual weight of names and money made it happen. He found her in a bare room with yellow walls. She smelled of a brain trauma patient's heavy body cream, and something sweet beneath.

He wanted to see behind her eyes. He wanted to fight the black blood dragon in her brain.

   

She breathes out, and the laptop screen becomes a snowstorm. 

They did it with cats first: decoded the visual centre of the brain, stitched fragments of feline dreams together with electricity and algorithms. At first, the images are hazy. The main window shows an amber flame, dancing and wavering. The software tries to match it to a grid of YouTube video clips, a mosaic mined from the collective subconscious. 

A growing flower. A couple, kissing. A nuclear explosion. A spinning shuriken. A queen, turning into a cartoon witch. A beating heart. 

An apple. 

He stares at it. Its colours flicker from red to green and back. It is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. 

She is a broken shell around the kernel of that perfect image. Her skin is paper-thin, full of wounds and bedsores. Her teeth are marred by caries. The dream of the apple is poison. Slowly, it will eat her away. 

He can't let that happen. 

He takes out a glass bottle with an obscure label and fills a syringe. With sure fingers, he finds a blue vein in her arm. The clear fluid goes in, smoothly: another impossible thing that only a prince could buy. When the needle comes out, it leaves behind a tiny drop of blood on her skin, a ruby sphere, perfectly formed. He kisses it away. 

He disconnects her from the machines, gently removes the drips, untangles her raven hair from the electrodes. The green lines on the screens go flat. 

He holds her hand and waits. 

Outside, there is birdsong.
