	






I am not who you think I am. 

I am death, and you should stay away from me. 

It's not personal. You woke me up, even if I had to die, for an eyeblink. And you look nice, sitting there in your white coat, with your slicked-back hair and Biaritz tan and expensive watch and a faint smell of pine in your aftershave. I feel a bit  warm, like when I bummed cigarettes from the boys at the R-store, my fingernails painted black. But if you don't let me go, I will be your death. 

You look a little frightened, and you should. 

I was my mother's death: she wanted a daughter made from snow and blood and a raven's wing, and there is only one place where such a wish leads. She wanted a daughter who was *just so*, perfect skin and hair and lips. 

My father wanted me to be her image when she was gone, and when I couldn't, he started dying, slowly. 
[FIXME more about this?]

No, I don't want a glass of water. But I need to borrow your phone. I'll just send a message while we talk. 

To my stepmother, I was a reflection of her death, the end of youth and beauty. She knew it, always. Even when I was a little girl, reading comics about Bamse the World's Strongest Bear and wanted to ride his horse, pretended to be his friend Kilpinen the turtle and pulled my head inside my shirt. I cut paper, made snowflakes and attached them to our windows; they left bluetack marks when she took them away, like little fingerprints. 

I will be the death of the man with the camera: he did not do as he was told, and in time, he will pay. 

The little men thought they saved me, but they just saw wat they wanted, too: a mother in a tight T-shirt and pert boobs. A Weird Science girl. If I had stayed, I would have been the death of their friendship, the thing one of them had to have all to himself. 

In a way, it was a blessing when she sent the message. I knew it was her, the instant my phone vibrated in my pocket. I could feel it in its warm rounded curves and sleek glass. I tried not to read it, but how could I not? 

It was poison. The letters spelled out a toxin, like a long chemical formula. IT'S YOUR FAULT HE DIED, it said. A link to a news page: the car crash. If I had not run away, it would not have happened. In the end, I was my father's death, too. 

I stared at it until my eyes hurt. 

I found the TKs in Jyri's room. I swallowed them without water. It was better to be nothing than a reflection, silence rather than an echo. 

It hurt a bit at first, in my belly and between my temples. Then the dreams came like rain. 

I can see it in your eyes, too. Looking for something you desperately want to see. You think you have won me, rescued me, woken me from a sleep like death. But you have to understand: they will take me away from you, once they find out I am alive. I will be a princess, back from the dead. It will be the only headline, in blue and yellow and red. 

I was a vampire princess, cold and hard, who made a pact with the old forces of the earth, ancient gods who took the shape of little men, and fought with a dark queen who wanted an immortal's blood. 

I was an android girl, a pleasure machine without a heart, sold off and sent to the scrapyard by a jealous wife; taken in by mining bots on distant Mars and deactivated by a secret code, only to wake again in the distant future where the sun burned red, by a posthuman god looking to understand humanity. 

I was a hundred other princesses who existed only to die and come back again and to reflect others' hopes and dreams, and it took me all this time to dream a way out of the mirror. Sometimes you have to dream to wake up. 

You don't believe me. You think we will fall in love and marry. My stepmother will come to our wedding and stare at our happiness, face red with rage, spiky heels tapping impotently on the dance floor. Can you hear it? Tap-tap-tap. Tap-tap-tap. 

You have to excuse me for a little joke. That's only my friend Jyri at the door. 

Jyri, say hi. No, don't cry. It's me, and I missed you too. 

Now, did you bring it? 

Yes, it's perfect. I knew I could count on you. Please tell the others thank you, and that I am sorry. Goodbye. 

[FIXME perhaps it's just a parcel -- this is a bit awkward here.]

You said I died, for a little bit, when you brought me back. That's the way it has to be. Lumi never woke up and died in her sleep. If you love me, you can do that for me, change the records and find some nameless body who can be Lumi instead of me. 

Thank you. You deserve a real kiss for that, and more. 

Come closer. 

My body is broken. My teeth hurt, my hair is in tatters, my limbs skinny and full of sores, but it does not matter. You untangle the electrodes from my hair while kissing my neck. On the screen of your laptop, the apple is red. And then you are my little death, and I am yours. 

You are still asleep when I wrap the hospital gown around me, take the passport that Jyri brought. I whisper a goodbye to you and leave. 

It has snowed during the night, light spring snow, soft and wet. The birdsong in the trees is made soft by the blanket on the ground. All the world is white, like blank paper, a beginning.
