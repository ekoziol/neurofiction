I hunt for the princess in the forest of the geeks. 

It is late afternoon. Golden light hits the old factory’s red brick walls. It would make a good shot, if not for the kids wearing makeup and carrying padded giant swords. 

I could be in a helicopter now, stalking the F1 Driver, to catch a candid shot of his mistress who likes to roll in the snow after going to the sauna. But no, I am at a science fiction convention, to make a little girl look bad, because of a phone call. 

*Bring me a picture of her. The kind you do best. You know what I mean.*

And I have no choice but to obey the Voice. The Voice knows too much, and has chilly fingers around my balls.  

The metal of the camera is cold in my hands. I take a few shots, just to warm up. Boys with paper bags over their heads, in blood-spattered coveralls. Manga-costumed jailbait chicks in pink leggings and schoolgirl uniforms, pillow lips blue from the cold. Stormtroopers and batmen. No sign of the princess yet. A part of me wonders what she has done to deserve this. 

A flash of yellow and blue. *There*. I snap a photo, and almost drop the camera when a zombie princess growls at me, thrusting a pair of blood-spattered pair of boobs at my face. Her teeth glint yellow against pale white makeup.

There are many princesses here, all in the same colours. Superhero versions, vampire versions, even a cross-dressing one. I swear. It is getting dark already, and there is not going to be enough light for a good shot if I don't find her soon. My gut tightens.  

The shots get better, though. Muscular young guys with spiky hairdos and impossibly large swords, sitting in a circle with a cardboard robot, playing Dungeons and Dragons. Six-year-olds dressed up as Hattivattis from the Moomin books. I find myself actually enjoying it. There used to be a time I tried to *see* things through the camera, didn't think about the headlines in black, red and yellow. After a while, I just led the colours and images flow in through the lens, without thinking. 

Then I see her. She sits on the sidewalk, oblivious to the cold. There is a bruise on her cheek that is either very well made up or real. She is smoking a joint, eyes closed. There is my shot: the minister's daughter, passed out in a Snow White costume, getting high. I raise the camera. 

But I can’t help seeing things as they are, through the lens.  

The bruise is real. There are dark rings around her eyes. She watches the crowd with a strange hunger, looking for something. Suddenly, I know she doesn't want to go home. 

My finger freezes on the trigger and I just watch her. I wait until the last light dies and all the creatures around me look grey. I watch her disappear among them. 

I fumble with the memory card and my iPad, a cigarette in my mouth. I flick through the pictures. I pick the one with the zombie princess with the big tits and send it to the Voice. 

It makes a whooshing sound as it goes, like a helicopter blade.
