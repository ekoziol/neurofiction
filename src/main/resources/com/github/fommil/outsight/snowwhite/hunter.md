# The Huntsman

The photographer hunts for the princess in the forest of the geeks. 

It is late afternoon. Golden light hits the old factory’s red brick walls. It would make a good shot, if not for the kids wearing makeup and carrying padded giant swords. 

He could be in a helicopter now, stalking the F1 Driver, to catch a candid shot of his mistress who likes to roll in the snow after going to the sauna. But no, he has to be at a science fiction convention, to make a little girl look bad, because of a phone call. 

Bring me a picture of her. The kind you do best. You know what I mean.

And he has no choice but to obey the Voice. The Voice knows too much, and has chilly fingers around his balls.  

The metal of the camera is cold in his hands. He takes a few shots, just to warm up. Boys with paper bags over their heads, in blood-spattered coveralls. Manga-costumed jailbait chicks in pink leggings and schoolgirl uniforms, pillow lips blue from the cold. Stormtroopers and batmen. No sign of the princess yet. A part of him wonders what she has done to deserve this. 

A flash of yellow and blue. *There*. He snaps a photo, and almost drop the camera when a zombie princess growls at him, thrusting a pair of blood-spattered pair of boobs at his face. Her teeth glint yellow against pale white makeup.

There are many princesses here, all in the same colours. Superhero versions, vampire versions, even a cross-dressing one. He swears. It is getting dark already, and there is not going to be enough light for a good shot if he doesn’t find her soon. His gut tightens.  

The shots get better, though. Muscular young guys with spiky hairdos and impossibly large swords, sitting in a circle with a cardboard robot, playing Dungeons and Dragons. Six-year-olds dressed up as Hattivattis from the Moomin books. He realises he is actually enjoying it. There used to be a time he tried to *see* things through the camera, didn't think about the headlines in black, red and yellow. After a while, he just lets the colours and images flow in through the lens, without thinking. 

Then he sees her. She sits on the sidewalk, oblivious to the cold. There is a bruise on her cheek that is either very well made up or real. She is smoking a joint, eyes closed. There is his shot: the minister's daughter, passed out in a Snow White costume, getting high. He raises the camera. 

But he can’t help seeing things as they are, through the lens.  

The bruise is real. There are dark rings around her eyes. She watches the crowd with a strange hunger, looking for something. Suddenly, he knows she doesn't want to go home. 

His finger freezes on the trigger. For a moment, he just watches her. He waits until the last light dies and all the creatures around him look grey. She disappears among them. 

He fumbles with the memory card and his iPad, a cigarette in his mouth. He flicks through the pictures. He picks the one with the zombie princess with the big tits and sends it to the Voice. 

It makes a whooshing sound as it goes, like a helicopter blade.
