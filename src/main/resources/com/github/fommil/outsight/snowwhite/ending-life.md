# Life

I am everything you could ever want. I am everything that you can’t buy, you who sit there in your white coat, with your slicked-back hair and Biaritz tan and expensive watch and a faint smell of pine in your aftershave. 

I am life. I am innocence. I am fragile. I am sweet. I am the thing you made, from chemicals and electric dreams. 

So just for you, I make myself look weaker than I am, after my waking, so you can rush to my side and adjust the pillows and offer me a glass of water. I let your hand touch mine as I take it and drink, slowly. Your fingers are warm, your breath eager and quick. My lips are dry and ragged, my hair a tangled mess. It doesn't matter. The magic is still there. 

This is the game of the mirror. I make you see what you want to see. 

It was my father the king who showed me how to play. He told me I was special, that I was not like the other little girls. My mother brought me from the fairy kingdom with a wish, made me from snow and blood and a raven’s wing. 

If I showed him my mother’s face, he would do anything I wanted. If I smiled just so, he would smile and buy me a Princess Barbie. If I chewed on my hair just right, his face would darken, and he would go to his office to sit still, covering his eyes with his hands.  

All that was his would have been mine. Until she came, to fill the hole my mother had left, to stop my father’s life from leaking out. And she knew me for what I was, a thing just like her. The mirror game between us was an infinite corridor of reflections, a labyrinth of glass and smiles. 

She was older and stronger, the bitch. And so I had to run. 

She chased me, of course. The photographer was easy: his kind exist to see things in a square frame, through a lens. All it took to send him away was a self-inflicted bruise, a mournful look, to show him what he had lost. 

The boys in black would have built me a castle as long as I showed them a sexy little mother. It would have been a safe haven to build myself again, to grow strong. But she sent me a message, summoning me home, masked in grief and love and other lies. 

I knew it was a trap. I could never escape her. Unless she thought she had won. 

So I took my medicine. I would sleep until the time was right to wake. 

I slept and dreamed my revenge. 

I was a vampire princess, cold and hard, who made a pact with the old forces of the earth, ancient gods who took the shape of little men, and fought with a dark queen who wanted an immortal's blood. In the end, the queen drank too deep of undeath and burned in the sun. 

I was an android girl, a pleasure machine without a heart, sold off and sent to the scrapyard by a jealous AI; taken in by mining bots on distant Mars and deactivated by a secret code, only to wake again in the distant future where the sun burned red, by an alien god looking to understand humanity long gone. As a punishment, the AI was trapped in a singularity and turned on itself, devouring its own code as entropy burned it away. 

You woke me. I am not ungrateful. Before I take all that you have, I will make your dreams come true, as a true love should. 

You will nurse me back to health. We will be on the pages of all the papers, a miracle couple, the princess and her saviour. I will be shy at first, and broken; you will put me together piece by piece, kiss by kiss. 

We will get married in your family's country house, in midsummer, beneath the white flowers of bird cherry trees. 

My stepmother will come. We will smile mirrored smiles at each other, and then you will offer her a dance. 

And as the music rises and you swing her around, there will be a syringe in your hand. She will feel a little sting, like the peck of a bird. And then she will dance, dance in her high-heeled shoes until her feet burn, dance her life away. 

Now, help me up. I want to see the sunrise outside. I want to see the face of the world again. 

Oh yes. A blue sky, golden light, a red horizon. Black branches of trees against the white of snow, like writing. Birds, faintly singing, and then, silence.
