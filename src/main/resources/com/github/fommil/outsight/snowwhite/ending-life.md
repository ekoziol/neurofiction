I am everything you could ever want. 

I am life, and we are meant to be together. 

Just for you, I make myself look weaker than I am, so you can rush to my side and adjust the pillows and offer me a glass of water. I let your hand touch mine as I take it and drink, slowly. My lips are dry and ragged, my hair a tangled mess, but it doesn't matter, the magic is still there. You see what you want to see. 

You gave me life. And now we are going to play the game of the mirror. 

It was my father who showed me how to play. How I could make him do what I wanted when I smiled and showed him the face she wanted to see. I was his special child, her princess, an afterlife for my mother, a life she had made from snow and blood and a raven's wing. 

Then *she* came, and she recognised me for what I was. Someone like her, only younger and smarter. 

She took my father's life, and for that I was almost grateful: he had become withdrawn, his life running to the ground slowly, leaking from the hole my mother had left. But we could not play the mirror game together, without creating an infinite corridor, a glass labyrinth that would swallow us both. 

She was older and stronger. I had no choice but to run and hide, but she chased me. The photographer was easy: the square frame only contains what they put in it. All it took to send him away was a self-inflicted bruise and a sad look. 

As I hid with the little men -- so trusting, so innocent -- she sent me a message, saying that she wanted me to come home. I knew it was a trap, and realised that I would never escape unless she thought she had won. 

So I took my medicine. I got the dose wrong: it almost killed me, trapped me in other lives,

I was a vampire princess, cold and hard, who made a pact with the old forces of the earth, ancient gods who took the shape of little men, and fought with a dark queen who wanted an immortal's blood. 

I was an android girl, a pleasure machine without a heart, sold off and sent to the scrapyard by a jealous wife; taken in by mining bots on distant Mars and deactivated by a secret code, only to wake again in the distant future where the sun burned red, by an alien god looking to understand humanity long gone. 

I was a child princess who charmed animals and men with her song. 

You brought me back, and I am not ungrateful. Before it's time for me to take all that you have, I will make your dreams come true. 

You will nurse me back to health. We will be on the pages of all the papers, a miracle couple, our names in red and yellow and blue. I will be shy at first, and fragile, and broken; you will put me together piece by piece, kiss by kiss. I will visit the little men and thank them. 

We will get married in your family's country house, in the summer, beneath white flowers in the trees and birdsong. 

My stepmother will come. We will smile mirrored smiles at each other, and then you will offer her a dance. 

And as the music rises and you swing her around, there will be a syringe in your hand. She will feel a little sting, like the peck of a bird. And then she will dance, dance in her high-heeled shoes, dance her life away. 

Now, come here. Kiss me. Help me up: I want to see what it looks like outside. Oh yes. A blue sky, yellow light on walls of red brick. The black branches of trees against the white of snow. 

Distant birdsong, and then silence.
