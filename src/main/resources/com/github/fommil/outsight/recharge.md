Unfortunately, the brain scanner needs to be recharged for a few moments. This is easy to do, and we'd be grateful if you could do this for us:

1. Find the black mini USB cable (it should be attached to the computer).
2. Plug the cable into the EEG headset: the socket is beside the orange switch.
3. Confirm that the light is red. If not, contact a member of staff.
4. Let the device charge for approximately 10 minutes.

Once the device has been turned off, you can still read through the Insight / Outsight story... but obviously your brain activity will not be taken into account.

Press the **spacebar** if you would like to continue the experience without the headset.
