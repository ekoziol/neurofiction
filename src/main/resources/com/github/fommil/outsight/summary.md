Welcome to **Insight / Outsight**!

Over the next 10 minutes, you'll be shown a short story which will evolve depending on your subconscious responses.

During the story, you can press **spacebar** (or use the arrow keys) to scroll.

Pressing **Enter**, at the end of each chapter, will bring you to the next chapter.

If you make a mistake, and hit enter too early, just press the **Escape** button to go back to the last chapter.

Once you've told us who you are, we'll show you how to wear the brain scanner.
