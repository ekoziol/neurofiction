1. Ensure the headset is turned on (the blue light is on, and the cable is unplugged).
2. If the sensors are dry, apply a drop of the fluid to each to moisten (it's just salted water).
3. Place the headset on your head as shown in the diagram.
4. Maneuver the sensors to touch your scalp, instead of any hair.
5. Gently wiggle any *red* sensors, hopefully they will change to *amber* or *green* in the diagram.

When you are confident that we can read signals from your brain (you'll see wavy lines appear below) press the **spacebar** to begin.
